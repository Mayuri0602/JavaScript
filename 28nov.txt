    userNum=prompt("You entered the wrong number. Guess again :")
}
console.log("Congratulations, you entered the right number");


output: 

Guess the game number :67
You entered the wrong number. Guess again :45
You entered the wrong number. Guess again :30
Congratulations, you entered the right number

Q. For a given array of  numbers, print the square of each value using forEach loop.


let nums = [23, 45, 19, 36];
nums.forEach ((num) => {
    console.log(num*num);  //num**2
})


                               or


 let nums = [23, 45, 19, 36];
 let calSquare = (num) => {
    console.log(num**2);
 };
 nums.forEach(calSquare);


Q. We're given an array of marks of students. Filter out the marks of students who scored more than 90.


let marks = [89, 78, 90, 98, 50, 99, 92, 100];
let newArr = marks.filter( (val) => {
    return val > 90;
});
console.log(newArr);


Q.  Create an array of numbers. Use the reduce method to calculate sum and product of all numbers.


let arr = [1,2,3,4,5];
for (let i=1;i<arr.length;i++){
 arr[i-1] = i;
}
console.log(arr);

 let sum = arr.reduce((prev,curr) => {
         return  prev + curr;
 });
 console.log("sum = ",sum);

let factorial = arr.reduce((prev,curr) => {
        return prev * curr;
});
console.log("factorial = ",factorial);                                           //factorial==product



Q. For a given array with marks of students - [39,78,56,93,80,67]
Find the average marks of the entire class.


let marks = [39,78,56,93,80,67];
let sum=0;
for(let val of marks){
    sum += val;
}
let avg = sum/marks.length;
console.log(`avg marks of the class = ${avg}`);


output:-      

avg marks of the class = 68.83333333333333


Q. For a given array with prices of 5 items - [200,675,900,50,470]
All items have an offer of 10% OFF on them. Change the array to store final price after applying offer.



let items = [200,675,900,50,470];
let i = 0;    //i=index
for(let val of items){
    let offer = val / 10;
    items[i] = items[i] - offer;
    console.log(`value after offer = ${items[i]}`);
    i++;
}

             or

let items = [200,675,900,50,470];
for(let i=0;i<items.length;i++){
    let offer = items[i]/10;
    items[i] -= offer;
}
console.log(items);


output:-


value after offer = 180
value after offer = 607.5
value after offer = 810
value after offer = 45
value after offer = 423

               or

(5) [180, 607.5, 810, 45, 423]

companies.shift();
console.log(companies);
companies.splice(1,1,"Ola");
console.log(companies);
companies.push("Amazon");
console.log(companies);
