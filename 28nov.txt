    userNum=prompt("You entered the wrong number. Guess again :")
}
console.log("Congratulations, you entered the right number");

Q. For a given array of  numbers, print the square of each value using forEach loop.


let nums = [23, 45, 19, 36];
nums.forEach ((num) => {
    console.log(num*num);  //num**2
})


                               or


 let nums = [23, 45, 19, 36];
 let calSquare = (num) => {
    console.log(num**2);
 };
 nums.forEach(calSquare);


Q. We're given an array of marks of students. Filter out the marks of students who scored more than 90.


let marks = [89, 78, 90, 98, 50, 99, 92, 100];
let newArr = marks.filter( (val) => {
    return val > 90;
});
console.log(newArr);


Q.  Create an array of numbers. Use the reduce method to calculate sum and product of all numbers.


let arr = [1,2,3,4,5];
for (let i=1;i<arr.length;i++){
 arr[i-1] = i;
}
console.log(arr);

 let sum = arr.reduce((prev,curr) => {
         return  prev + curr;
 });
 console.log("sum = ",sum);

let factorial = arr.reduce((prev,curr) => {
        return prev * curr;
});
console.log("factorial = ",factorial);                                           //factorial==product
